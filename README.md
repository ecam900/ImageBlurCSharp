# ImageBlurCSharp
Practice with multidimensional arrays in C. It will be deployed in three stages: <br />

<b>1. Printing out multidimensional array. (DONE)</b> <br />
Will just print out the multidimensional array. Will use nested forloop for this.<br />
<b>2. Image transformation at a specific pixel.</b><br />
Each time the loop finds a "1" in the array, it will change the "0" to a "1" one level up, down, left and right to it. <br />
<b>3. Manhattan Distance transformation.</b><br />
Will changea all possible "pixels" within the range of motion passed to the blur method.
