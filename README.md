# ImageBlurCSharp
Practice with multidimensional arrays in C. It will be deployed in three stages:

<b>1. Printing out multidimensional array</b>
   - Will just print out the multidimensional array. Will use nested forloop for this.
<b>2. Image transformation at a specific pixel.</b>
   - Will change specific "pixel", and those one level up, down, left and right to it.
<b>3. Manhattan Distance transformation.</b>
   - Will changea all possible "pixels" within the range of motion passed to the blur method.
