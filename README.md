# ImageBlurCSharp
Practice with multidimensional arrays in C. It will be deployed in three stages: <br />

<b>1. Printing out multidimensional array</b> <br />
Will just print out the multidimensional array. Will use nested forloop for this.<br />
<b>2. Image transformation at a specific pixel.</b><br />
Will change specific "pixel", and those one level up, down, left and right to it. <br />
<b>3. Manhattan Distance transformation.</b><br />
Will changea all possible "pixels" within the range of motion passed to the blur method.
